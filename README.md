Supernova is an applied blockchain which has two main chains that work with strong coupling. 
One chain uses POW technology to solve security issues; the other chain solves performance problems and achieves scalability.
It can realize cross-chain interoperability of BTC, ETH (including many ERC20 tokens), EOS and other mainstream public chains as well as some alliance chains and private chains, break through the free communication of information flow and asset flow, and solve the island problem.  
In the Supernova dual-chain system, the application chain adopts the DPOS + PBFT consensus mechanism, and has functions such as cross-chain protocol, anti-quantum computing, and decentralized payment. Supernova's vision is to break the "impossible triangle" of blockchain in which a dual-chain system can tackle issues of security, decentralization and scalability simultaneously, achieve the following service directions:
1. Inclusive participation allows more users to enter the field of cryptocurrency.
2. Give full play to the efficient and transparent role of the decentralized system to achieve credible circulation of assets on different chains.
3. Help the implementation of blockchain projects and realize more blockchain application services.
